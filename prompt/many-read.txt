create a read function that accepts bucket string , list_ch channel of strings , read_ch channel of strings.
the read function should use the official sdk for go v2: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/getting-started.html
the read function should read a s3 key string from the channel of strings
then read the key content, and parse it into string.
each object content as string and content as string only should be inserted to read_ch channel of strings.
the read function should run in infinite loop, every time try to read from list_ch a single s3 key read it's content and put it inside read_ch.
write as simple as possible code, don't optimize.
all the creds would be taken from the env vars by default aws cred chain, don't pass anything expicit.
the region would from the env vars by default aws cred chain, don't pass anything expicit.
exception should only be logged, no fancy shit.
