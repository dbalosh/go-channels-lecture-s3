create a list function that accepts bucket string , prefix string , list_ch channel of strings.
the list function should use the official sdk for go v2: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/getting-started.html
it should list all the object at paramter bucket, and filter by given prefix paramter.
the filter must be inside the s3 backend, do not use filter on the client side, don't iterate all keys and filter, pass the paramter as filter param.
every time list the next 1000 objects.
each object key and key only should be inserted to list_ch channel of strings.
when all objects exhausted, the function should finish.
write as simple as possible code, don't optimize.
all the creds would be taken from the env vars by default aws cred chain, don't pass anything expicit.
the region would from the env vars by default aws cred chain, don't pass anything expicit.
